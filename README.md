# Simulation of Dynamic Systems

## Objective of the course – aims of the course unit:
The aim of the course is to make students familiar with the methods and selected software supporting the computer simulation.
Students will be able to use software methods and applications for simulation.

## Prerequisites:
Fundamentals of mathematics, including differential and integral calculus of functions in one and more variables and solution of system differential equations. Fundamentals of physics, mechanics, electrical engineering and automatic control, knowledge of programming techniques in environment C/C++ and Matlab.

## Course contents (annotation):
Modeling and Simulation is a discipline for developing a level of understanding of the interaction of the parts of a system, and of the system as a whole. The course is focused to continues, discrete and hybrid simulation. Modeling and Simulating by means of finite automata, cellular automata and Petri nets. Modeling and simulating complex reactive systems. Random Number Generation and Monte Carlo Methods. Design of simulation experiments, HIL simulation, visualization and verification.

## Assesment methods and criteria linked to learning outcomes:
Course-unit credit is conditional on completing of computer projects. Exam has a written and an oral part and tests students’ knowledge of the subject-matter covered in the course.
